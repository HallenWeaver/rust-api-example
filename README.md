# rust-api-example

## Summary
Hello, and welcome to my implementation of an API in the language Rust!
I have no prior experience with the language, and therefore the implementation may not be precise or follow common guidelines and standards.
I hope this can be useful to you!

## Objective
The objective of this API is to demonstrate skills and knowledge while building an API with the programming language **Rust**.
This API must return data on fictional characters from my unreleased book series, and the following operations must be supported:
| Operation                 | Description |
| -----------               | ----------- |
| Create a new character    | Must create a new character with basic information such as name, age and gender   |
| Read character data       | Must be able to list characters, or get a single character by its id              | 
| Update character data     | Must be able to update a character's data                                         |
| Delete character data     | Must be able to delete a character's data                                         |

## Implementation
The business rules must be implemented in this project through sole usage of the language Rust, while the database responsible for holding the data will be, initially, an in-memory solution until I figure out how to integrate a mongoDB connection.
